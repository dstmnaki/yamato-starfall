WIP RELEASE

Toss the 2 folders to data/starfall/ in garry's mod, ignore the one titled EXPRESSION2 that is for converting pac3's pac to e2 holo format into my sf holo loader format, take it if you wish to convert your own models

Spawn the file titled "yamato" in slashblade_project/ it might take a bit to load, also in case you run into holo limit issues, sf_holograms_max_cl 1000, sf_timebuffer_cl_owner 0.25 if you hit cpu quota


Starfall Permissions (should be all)

sf_permission entities.setPos entities 1
sf_permission entities.setPos usergroups 1
sf_permission entities.setVelocity entities 1
sf_permission entities.setVelocity usergroups 1
sf_permission player.modifyMovementProperties entities 1
sf_permission player.modifyMovementProperties usergroups 1
sf_permission entities.blockDamage entities 1
sf_permission entities.blockDamage usergroups 1
sf_permission entities.applyDamage entities 1
sf_permission entities.applyDamage usergroups 1

-- following commands are client side

sf_holograms_max_cl 500 (i can't say anything lower won't cause problems if you spam attacks such as judgement cut)

sf_timebuffer_cl_owner 0.1 (if left at default '0.015' you will definetelly hit the cpu quota, 0.1 should be fine, 0.2 if it tick quota exceeds)


Requires the following, nothing should be missing but i can't say for sure

StarfallEx (neo starfall should also work)

Style System:

D|C|B|A|S|SS|SSS - Ranks
2|3|5|7|9|11|15  - Damage Multiplier /9

the value is divided by 9 (x/9) so at style S you get *1 damage multiplier, the style meter builds up as you make successfull connections when you attack, move spam is detected, so you should switch around, use special attacks etc, if you just spam mouse 1, the meter will build up very slowly, and towards the end the reduction rate will be higher than what you can get from spamming light attack, so you won't be able to get past S rank damage!
the more you spam one move, the slower your style meter fills, if you switch attacks, the reduction multiplier will reset
