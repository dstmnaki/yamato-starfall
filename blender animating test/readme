Here's a wip blender plugin for converting the animation data to the starfall format i use, this was created using chatgpt, it works as far as i have tested, i haven't done extensive testing on the root/torso angles, but it should work just fine, i had to negate 90 from pitch so if any issues arrive, i'll try to fix them

Tested on blender 3.2 but should work all the way up to 4+ and as low as 2.8

Do not change the bone names, you also can't add more bones, so if you want to mess around with ik, add a control rig on top

formatting

--@name slashblade_project/anim/<animation_name_lower_case>.txt
<animation_name_upper_case>={
{
torso angle,
left upper arm angle,
left forearm angle,
left hand angle,
sheath angle,
right upper arm angle,
right forearm angle,
right hand angle,
sword angle,
frame length (empty frames between keyframes, from current to next),
true/false (sword in hand? this is automatically set to true as most animations have the sword out of sheath, set it to false if you need to sheath the sword)
} <- comma ',' will be added automatically if you have more frames
}
